## 1.4.2

### Patch Changes

- 108c1d4: Cross-package security and correctness audit.
  - **authentication**: `JwtAuthenticationIssuer.parse` now receives both the raw `token` and the decoded `payload` (was just `payload`) — implementations **must** verify the signature against trusted key material because the payload is unverified. `JwtProvider` accepts an optional `pemPublicKey` and now verifies tokens with the public key (derived from the private PEM when not supplied) so verification paths never have to hold the signing key. `updateSession` resets `expiresAt` to `now + expiration` (absolute) instead of stacking it on top of the existing expiry — a chatty client can no longer extend a session past its configured lifetime. FIDO assertion verification rejects factors that are missing their replay counter instead of silently degrading to "no counter check". Magic-link redirect HTML now embeds the URL via `JSON.stringify` so the assignment string cannot be escaped. Authorization-header parsing splits on the first space only, preserving multi-token credentials such as `Digest username="…", nonce="…"`.
  - **encryption**: `EncryptionProvider.createKey` is now `async` and derives keys with **Argon2id** (the OWASP-recommended memory-hard KDF, shared with `Argon2idPasswordHashProvider` via the new `ARGON2ID_DEFAULTS` export) instead of PBKDF2-HMAC-SHA512 at 65 535 iterations. Callers must `await` and any keys previously derived from a passphrase will no longer match — re-derive and re-encrypt. The per-id lock chain inside `InMemoryKmsProvider` was rewritten with `async`/`await`, fixing a `prev.then(fn, fn)` bug that broke serialisation when a queued operation rejected. Removed an unreachable `KeyRetiredError` guard on the encrypt path. `kms/in-memory.kms.provider.ts` renamed to `kms/in.memory.kms.provider.ts` to match the project's dot-separated filename convention — deep imports must update the path.
  - **errors**: The `@OnError` decorator now **rethrows** the original error after invoking the handler. Handlers that map errors continue to work (they throw their replacement, which short-circuits the rethrow); handlers that only logged and swallowed will start propagating errors. `isPostgresError` is stricter — it requires `code` to be a string in the 5-character SQLSTATE shape, so generic Node errors (`ENOENT`, axios errors with a `code`, etc.) are no longer mis-routed through the Postgres mapper.
  - **appconfig**: `AppConfigProviderGcpSecrets.getSecret` now throws a `ServerkitError` (with the original error attached as `cause` and `secretId` / `projectId` in `internalDetails`) when Secret Manager rejects, instead of silently substituting `''` and booting the service with empty passwords / API keys. `canParse` resets the regex's `lastIndex` before testing, fixing a stateful-`/g`-flag bug that returned `false` for matching strings on subsequent calls. `AppConfigBuilder.build()` now returns an empty config when no sources are registered instead of crashing on `deepmerge()` of zero arguments. Added a workspace dependency on `@maroonedsoftware/errors`.
  - **jobbroker**: `PgBossJobRunner` now `await`s `pgboss.work(...)` and wraps the per-batch job execution in `Promise.allSettled`, so pg-boss no longer marks a batch complete before the jobs have actually finished. Each job in a batch now resolves its own `Job` instance from the DI container, matching the documented "resolved for each execution" contract.
  - **koa**: `requireSignature` middleware compares HMAC digests with `crypto.timingSafeEqual` (with a length guard for missing/short signatures) instead of `!==`, removing a timing-attack vector on webhook signatures.
  - **scim**: `ScimUserService` and `ScimGroupService` use Luxon `DateTime.utc().toISO()` for `meta.created` / `meta.lastModified` instead of native `Date#toISOString()`, matching the project-wide Luxon convention.
