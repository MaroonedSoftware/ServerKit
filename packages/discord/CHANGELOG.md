## 1.1.0

### Minor Changes

- dfe5304: Security and robustness hardening across the workspace.

  - **appconfig**: reject `__proto__`/`constructor`/`prototype` key segments in `nestKeys` (prototype-pollution guard), isolate config-change listener errors so one throwing listener can't abort a reload, replace arrays on deep-merge (last-wins) instead of concatenating, and make secret/env resolver prefixes non-greedy and always global.
  - **authentication**: atomically claim the refresh-token `jti` (via the new `CacheProvider.add`) to close a refresh-reuse race, pin JWT verification to `RS256`, bound failed OTP/code attempts on the authenticator/email/phone factors (new `maxValidationAttempts`/`maxVerificationAttempts` options, HTTP 429 when exceeded), and split Basic credentials on the first colon only.
  - **cache**: add `CacheProvider.add` (atomic set-if-absent claim primitive) and make `update` apply `XX` so an expired key is not resurrected without a TTL.
  - **discord/slack/telegram/whatsapp**: add a per-request `requestTimeoutMs` (default 10s), redact secret tokens from REST-client logs, and neutralize `@everyone`/`@here`/broadcast mentions in outgoing text. Discord additionally acks multi-reply interactions out of band.
  - **koa**: reject `origin: '*'` combined with `credentials: true`, honor an inbound `X-Request-Id`, bound the binary parser body (new `BinaryParserOptions`, 20MB default, HTTP 413), and resolve wildcard media-type registrations (e.g. `application/*+json`).
  - **multipart**: bound field/parts counts by default (`MAX_FIELDS`/`MAX_PARTS`) so a field flood cannot exhaust memory.
  - **errors**: map Postgres foreign-key violations (23503) to HTTP 409 Conflict instead of 404.
  - **scim**: enforce `userName` required and unique on user PATCH (400/409).
  - **permissions-dsl**: reject reserved namespace names (JS keywords, permission builders, the `model` export) that would otherwise generate uncompilable output.
  - **utilities**: accept UUID versions 6/7/8 in `isUuid`.
  - **storage**: write files atomically (temp file + rename) so a mid-write crash can't leave a truncated file readable as complete.
  - **jobbroker**: reject the pg-boss work handler when a job in the batch fails so retry/dead-letter policies actually apply.
  - **johnny5**: strip dotenv inline comments on unquoted values without corrupting quoted ones.
  - **zod**: fall back to a stable message for issue codes that carry none.

## 1.0.0

### Minor Changes

- fe8ec2c: Add a `./comms` adapter subpath to each chat package, binding it to the channel-agnostic `@maroonedsoftware/comms` router (declared as an optional peer dependency). Each exposes `dispatch<Channel>…` functions that normalize the channel's inbound payloads into comms events and a `create<Channel>Notifier` for proactive sends, so a single handler runs across every wired channel. The channel cores are unchanged.
- ab4acc2: Add `@maroonedsoftware/discord`: a transport-agnostic Discord integration modeled on `@maroonedsoftware/slack`. Includes `DiscordDispatcher` for routing interactions (slash commands, message components, modals, autocomplete) to typed handlers, Ed25519 signature verification (`verifyDiscordSignature` + `DiscordSignaturePolicy`) implemented with Node's native `crypto` (no third-party dependency), a `fetch`-based `DiscordClient` REST wrapper, and DI-friendly `DiscordConfig`/`DiscordError`. Targets the HTTP interactions endpoint; real-time Gateway events are out of scope.
