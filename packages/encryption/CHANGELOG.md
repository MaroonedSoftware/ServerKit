# @maroonedsoftware/encryption

## 0.5.2

### Patch Changes

- 3422e87: Replace native JS `Date` with Luxon `DateTime` throughout, per the repo's date/time convention. Native `Date` now appears only at true interop boundaries (e.g. converting a third-party adapter's `Date` with `DateTime.fromJSDate`).

  **Breaking — `@maroonedsoftware/authentication`:** OAuth 2.0 / OIDC token and factor types now use `DateTime` instead of `Date`:
  - `OAuth2Tokens.expiresAt` is now `DateTime | undefined`. Adapters implementing `OAuth2ProviderClient` must convert at the boundary — e.g. `DateTime.fromJSDate(arcticTokens.accessTokenExpiresAt())`.
  - `OAuth2FactorValue.refreshTokenExpiresAt`, `OidcFactorValue.refreshTokenExpiresAt`, and the `updateRefreshToken(...)` `refreshTokenExpiresAt` argument are now `DateTime` (optional; omit for a non-expiring refresh token, where the type was previously `Date | null`). Repository implementations that persist to a `timestamptz` column should call `.toJSDate()` on write and `DateTime.fromJSDate(...)` on read.
  - `OAuth2FactorService.refreshAccessToken(...)` now resolves `expiresAt?: DateTime` (was `Date | null`).

  **Breaking — `@maroonedsoftware/johnny5`:** `DaemonStatus.startedAt` is now a `DateTime` (was `Date`). The on-disk pid record is unchanged (still an ISO string).

  `@maroonedsoftware/encryption`, `@maroonedsoftware/koa`, and `@maroonedsoftware/slack` change only internal time computations (KMS decrypt-audit timestamp, rate-limit reset header, Slack signature default `now`); no public API change. `luxon` is added as a runtime dependency to `encryption`, `johnny5`, and `koa`.

## 0.5.1

### Patch Changes

- a167ee3: Bump runtime dependencies (notably `injectkit` to 1.4.1) and relax the pgboss job registration type guard so it accepts the updated `Identifier` shape.

## 0.5.0

### Minor Changes

- 108c1d4: Cross-package security and correctness audit.
  - **authentication**: `JwtAuthenticationIssuer.parse` now receives both the raw `token` and the decoded `payload` (was just `payload`) — implementations **must** verify the signature against trusted key material because the payload is unverified. `JwtProvider` accepts an optional `pemPublicKey` and now verifies tokens with the public key (derived from the private PEM when not supplied) so verification paths never have to hold the signing key. `updateSession` resets `expiresAt` to `now + expiration` (absolute) instead of stacking it on top of the existing expiry — a chatty client can no longer extend a session past its configured lifetime. FIDO assertion verification rejects factors that are missing their replay counter instead of silently degrading to "no counter check". Magic-link redirect HTML now embeds the URL via `JSON.stringify` so the assignment string cannot be escaped. Authorization-header parsing splits on the first space only, preserving multi-token credentials such as `Digest username="…", nonce="…"`.
  - **encryption**: `EncryptionProvider.createKey` is now `async` and derives keys with **Argon2id** (the OWASP-recommended memory-hard KDF, shared with `Argon2idPasswordHashProvider` via the new `ARGON2ID_DEFAULTS` export) instead of PBKDF2-HMAC-SHA512 at 65 535 iterations. Callers must `await` and any keys previously derived from a passphrase will no longer match — re-derive and re-encrypt. The per-id lock chain inside `InMemoryKmsProvider` was rewritten with `async`/`await`, fixing a `prev.then(fn, fn)` bug that broke serialisation when a queued operation rejected. Removed an unreachable `KeyRetiredError` guard on the encrypt path. `kms/in-memory.kms.provider.ts` renamed to `kms/in.memory.kms.provider.ts` to match the project's dot-separated filename convention — deep imports must update the path.
  - **errors**: The `@OnError` decorator now **rethrows** the original error after invoking the handler. Handlers that map errors continue to work (they throw their replacement, which short-circuits the rethrow); handlers that only logged and swallowed will start propagating errors. `isPostgresError` is stricter — it requires `code` to be a string in the 5-character SQLSTATE shape, so generic Node errors (`ENOENT`, axios errors with a `code`, etc.) are no longer mis-routed through the Postgres mapper.
  - **appconfig**: `AppConfigProviderGcpSecrets.getSecret` now throws a `ServerkitError` (with the original error attached as `cause` and `secretId` / `projectId` in `internalDetails`) when Secret Manager rejects, instead of silently substituting `''` and booting the service with empty passwords / API keys. `canParse` resets the regex's `lastIndex` before testing, fixing a stateful-`/g`-flag bug that returned `false` for matching strings on subsequent calls. `AppConfigBuilder.build()` now returns an empty config when no sources are registered instead of crashing on `deepmerge()` of zero arguments. Added a workspace dependency on `@maroonedsoftware/errors`.
  - **jobbroker**: `PgBossJobRunner` now `await`s `pgboss.work(...)` and wraps the per-batch job execution in `Promise.allSettled`, so pg-boss no longer marks a batch complete before the jobs have actually finished. Each job in a batch now resolves its own `Job` instance from the DI container, matching the documented "resolved for each execution" contract.
  - **koa**: `requireSignature` middleware compares HMAC digests with `crypto.timingSafeEqual` (with a length guard for missing/short signatures) instead of `!==`, removing a timing-attack vector on webhook signatures.
  - **scim**: `ScimUserService` and `ScimGroupService` use Luxon `DateTime.utc().toISO()` for `meta.created` / `meta.lastModified` instead of native `Date#toISOString()`, matching the project-wide Luxon convention.

### Minor Changes

- e111278: feat: implement PKCE support in authentication package
  - Introduced `PkceProvider` for cache-backed storage of PKCE state, enabling OAuth 2.0 PKCE flows.
  - Updated `EmailFactorService` and `PhoneFactorService` to return `alreadyRegistered` flag for pending registrations, improving user experience by preventing duplicate notifications.
  - Enhanced README documentation with PKCE usage examples and details.
  - Added unit tests for `PkceProvider` and updated existing tests for email and phone factor services to cover new functionality.

## 0.3.0

### Minor Changes

- e9a18b6: refactor: extend KmsError to inherit from ServerkitError
  - Updated KmsError to extend ServerkitError, enhancing error handling capabilities.
  - This change allows KmsError to utilize the additional properties and methods provided by ServerkitError, improving consistency in error management across the application.
