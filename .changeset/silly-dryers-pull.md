Introduce HTTP Basic auth support: add BasicAuthenticationHandler that base64-decodes the credential, validates the scheme (must be exactly "basic"), splits username:password, and delegates verification to a DI-resolved BasicAuthenticationIssuer. Add an abstract BasicAuthenticationIssuer with an async verify(username, password) contract returning an AuthenticationContext.
